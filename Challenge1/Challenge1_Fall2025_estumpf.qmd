## Before you start: Create your R quarto project and submit the standalone .html file.

Please use Challenge 0 on Canvas as a practice of rendering html files. Find how to make standalone html files in week 1 lecture recordings.

## Setup

If you have not installed the following packages, please install them before loading them.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(haven) #for loading other datafiles (SAS, STATA, SPSS, etc.)
```

You will see a warning message saying "Conflicts: tidyverse_conflicts() – dplyr::filter() and dplyr::lag()". This message means that once you read the packages:

-   If you use `filter()`, the `filter()` from `dplyr` will be used, rather than the `filter()` from base R (`stats`). Similarly, if you use `lag()`, it will be the `lag()` from `dplyr`.

Generally, we can ignore this warning message.

## Challenge Overview

This first challenge aims to practice the following skill sets:

1.  Read datasets in different file types;

2.  Describe the datasets;

3.  Exploring a few basic functions of data transformation and wrangling and present some descriptive statistics (such as min, max, and median).

There will be coding components (reading datasets and data transformation) and writing components (describing the datasets and some statistical information). Please read the instructions for each part and complete your challenges.

There are three datasets provided in this challenge. Please download the following dataset files from Canvas and save them to a folder under your working directory (i.e.: “yourworkingdiectory_data”; you should also save all your R scripts and quarto files of a project in the same working directory). If you don’t have a folder to store the datasets, please create one.

-   athlete_events.csv ⭐
-   paintings.csv ⭐
-   babynames.csv ⭐⭐

Find the `_data` folder, then use the correct R command to read the datasets.

## Part 1. The Athlete Events Dataset

1.  **Read the dataset "athlete_events.csv", and check the first few rows:**

    ```{r}
    athleteEvents = read_csv("data/athlete_events.csv")
    head(athleteEvents)
    ```

2.  **Data Description: Please use the necessary commands and codes, and briefly describe this data with a short writing paragraph answering the following questions.**

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk. 

    #Outside the code chunk, please write a paragraph answering the following questions.
    athleteEventColumns <- colnames(athleteEvents)

    print("*** Question 1 Output ***")
    athleteEventsDim <- dim(athleteEvents)
    print(sprintf(
        'Rows Count: %s', 
        athleteEventsDim[1]
    ))
    print(sprintf(
        'Columns Count: %s', 
        athleteEventsDim[2]
    ))

    print("")
    print("*** Question 2 Output ***")
    print(sprintf(
        'Columns: %s', 
        paste(athleteEventColumns, collapse=", ")
    ))
    print(sprintf(
        'Year Range: %s - %s', 
        min(athleteEvents[10]),
        max(athleteEvents[10])
    ))

    print("")
    print("*** Question 4 Output ***")

    for (colNum in seq_along(athleteEvents)) {
      naCount <- sum(is.na(athleteEvents[colNum]))
      if (naCount > 0) {
        columnName <- athleteEventColumns[colNum]
        print(sprintf(
          "Column %s: %s NA values", 
          columnName, 
          naCount
        ))
      }
    }
    ```

    \(1\) What is the dimension of the data (# of rows and columns)?

    There are 271,116 rows and 15 columns

    \(2\) What do the rows and columns mean in this data?

    This dataset appears to house data about Olympic athletes from 1896 to 2016. It includes data about an athlete's name, sex, age, height, weight, team, nationality/country, Olympic Games name, Olympic Games year, Olympic sport, official Olympic event name, and what medal the athlete won (if any)

    \(3\) What is the unit of observation? In other words, what does each case mean in this data?

    The unit of observation is Olympic athletes, their Olympic events, and any medals the athlete won in the specific event

    \(4\) According to the lecture, is this a "tidy" data?

    No, multiple columns (Age, Height, and Weight) contain NA values. Note: the Medal column also contains NA values, but this is used to indicate that a given athlete didn't medal in the event.

3.  **Data Transformation: use necessary commands and codes and answer the following questions.**

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk.

    #Outside the code chunk, please write a paragraph answering the following questions.

    print("*** Question 1 Output ***")
    getUniqueCountForCol <- function(df, column) {
      df |>
        select(all_of(column)) |>
        distinct() |>
        count()
    }
    print(sprintf(
      'Unique Sports: %s',
      getUniqueCountForCol(athleteEvents, "Sport")
    ))
    print(sprintf(
      'Unique Teams: %s',
      getUniqueCountForCol(athleteEvents, "Team")
    ))
    print(sprintf(
      'Unique Names: %s',
      getUniqueCountForCol(athleteEvents, "Name")
    ))

    print("")
    print("*** Question 2 Output ***")
    print(sprintf(
        'Years Recorded: %s', 
        max(athleteEvents[10]) - min(athleteEvents[10])
    ))

    print("")
    print("*** Question 3 Output ***")
    print("TODO")
    ```

    There are 66 unique sports, 1,184 unique teams, and 134,731 unique names

    \(2\) How many years does this data record?

    120 years

    \(3\) Summarize the min, mean, median, and max of "Age" and "Weight". (Must use summarize())

    ```

    \(1\) How many unique museums are in the data?

    \(2\) What are the range and average of the following variable "year"? Must use summarize().

    \(3\) How many missing data (NA) are in the following variables: "year" and "depicts"? (tips: use is.na())

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk.
    ```

    \(2\) How many years of names does this data record?

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk.
    ```

    \(3\) Summarize the min, mean, median, and max of "Occurrence". (Must use summarize())

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk.
    ```

    \(4\) (Optional; the easiest way to complete this task requires the `lubridate` package; you can try it again after week 4) Summarize the min, mean, median, and max of "Occurrence" by decade. See the code and output above.

    ```{r}
    #Type your code in the code chunk.
    ```
